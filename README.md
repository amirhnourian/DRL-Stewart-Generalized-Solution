# Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning Solution for Stewart–Gough Platforms

This repository will soon host the **generalized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework** 
developed for solving the **time-optimal joint-space control and kinematic generalization** 
of **Serially-Connected Gough–Stewart Platforms (SCGPs)**.

The framework enables **model-free, end-to-end learning** across various initial and goal 
positions, eliminating the need for analytical kinematic models or datasets. The proposed 
DRL-based approach demonstrates strong **generalization, robustness to disturbances**, 
and the ability to handle **complex hyper-redundant motion tasks** efficiently.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The full code, documentation, and examples will be released here after 
final publication and repository structuring. Stay tuned for updates.
